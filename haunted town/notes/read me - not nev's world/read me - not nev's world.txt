rm_inside should probably not be implemented

unless each npc's x,y and state can be retrieved when switching rooms as if they were always existing
so, say we go inside a haunted building at 13:00, and then come out of the haunted building at 23:00,
you'd expect that each npc would be in their home by now or on their way home.

since npc objects cant continue their paths while the room is different, their x,y, path and state
would need to be determined at the point of returning to rm_main using only time

when going inside a haunted building, it may instead be better to effectively simulate a room change
by loading an object which:
	- has a large background sprite
	- disables any input on all objects outside the building
	- disables (or muffles?) any sound occuring outside the building
this would enable the world outside to carry on as usual
