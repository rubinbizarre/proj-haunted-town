rm_inside should probably not be implemented

unless each npc's x,y and state can be retrieved when switching rooms as if they were always existing
so, say we go inside a haunted building at 13:00, and then come out of the haunted building at 23:00,
you'd expect that each npc would be in their home by now or on their way home.

since npc objects cant continue their paths while the room is different, their x,y, path and state
would need to be determined at the point of returning to rm_main using only time

when going inside a haunted building, it may instead be better to effectively simulate a room change
by loading an object which:
	- has a large background sprite
	- disables any input on all objects outside the building
	- disables (or muffles?) any sound occuring outside the building
this would enable the world outside to carry on as usual


(notes on haunted world object):
if haunted
	if npc enters the haunt radius
		if npc has not entered this haunted objects radius before in a period of time
			tell npc to store its previous state
			change npc state to spooked


(notes on npc spooked state):
if state == spooked
	stop moving
	jump in place
	play animcurve spook once, apply to yscale
	change sprite to show fear
	after short delay change state back to previous state
