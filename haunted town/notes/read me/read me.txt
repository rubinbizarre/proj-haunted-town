starter house instance is set to is_haunted in its instance creation code, temporarily, for debug purposes

the animcurve anim_building_hover_v2 is set to make the house larger (2x) than the first version

pressing P will toggle pause. this will need to be prevented from executing when certain menus are active

currently there are 17 buildings in total
	- 15 residential buildings
		- 6 shacks (1 HP)	= 6 HP total
		- 7 houses (5 HP)	= 35 HP total
		- 2 manors (10 HP)	= 20 HP total
							-----------------
							= 61 HP net total
	- 2 unique purpose buildings
		- 1 hotel  (30 HP)	= 30 HP total
		- 1 church (50 HP)  = 50 HP total
							-----------------
							= 80 HP net total
							-------------------------------------------------------
							= (80 + 61) = 141 HP total needed to complete the game

141 npcs are not needed since
	- there are alternative methods to killing that will also grant HP and eventually completion
	- tourists who come to the town are not part of the initial population
