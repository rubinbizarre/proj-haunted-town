rm_inside should probably not be implemented

unless each npc's x,y and state can be retrieved when switching rooms as if they were always existing
so, say we go inside a haunted building at 13:00, and then come out of the haunted building at 23:00,
you'd expect that each npc would be in their home by now or on their way home.

since npc objects cant continue their paths while the room is different, their x,y, path and state
would need to be determined at the point of returning to rm_main using only time

when going inside a haunted building, it may instead be better to effectively simulate a room change
by loading an object which:
	- has a large background sprite
	- disables any input on all objects outside the building
	- disables (or muffles?) any sound occuring outside the building
this would enable the world outside to carry on as usual


(notes on haunted world object):
if haunted
	if npc enters the haunt radius
		if npc has not entered this haunted objects radius before in a period of time
			tell npc to store its previous state
			change npc state to spooked


(notes on npc spooked state):
if state == spooked
	stop moving
	jump in place
	play animcurve spook once, apply to yscale
	change sprite to show fear
	after short delay change state back to previous state


notes on Nev:
- Nev himself is an object
- Nev's van is an object
- Nev's equipment is not an object? could be a drawn sprite with effects determined by Nev var upgrade_tier
	- might need to be an object considering other tiers will have different vfx and sfx ... we'll see

Nev's van
	- has a schedule??? no... yes...
	- speed is faster than Nev himself tied to time_speed
	- does not obey the same collision... collisonless?
	- SLOWS / STOPS FOR PEDESTRIANS IN THE ROAD AHEAD ... OR DO PEDESTRIANS STOP FOR NEV ???
		- i think it makes more sense for pedestrians to stop for Nev, since he doesn't seem like the caring type
		- BEST TEMP SOLUTION: NPCs ARE TEMPORARILY FLATTENED WHEN RAN OVER BY NEV (more reason for player to dislike Nev)
			- image_angle set to 90, stop bob anim, path_speed zero
			- after short delay, revert image_angle and start bob anim again, revert path_speed
Nev himself is deployed by the van when it stops
	- move_speed = same as adult
	- drawn on top of npcs
	- Nev obeys collision

PSEUDO WORKING IT OUT
	- when it reaches 7 or 8 AM, starts a path from home to somewhere along a path between two obj_node_nev_van nodes
	- randomly decides a point along that path to stop - can't be anywhere where NPCs cross the roadw
	- when nev gets out, a flag is set to the van that it is idle - not going anywhere
	- nev ignores collision whilst he moves to the nearest obj_node_circuit node
	- upon arriving at the circuit node, he now obeys the same collision as NPCs
	- nev wanders about for a bit going between various POIs - sets a path from current pos to target x,y repeatedly
		- nev needs to be switching between various states whilst out of the van and able to record player activity etc
		- (let's say for now he does a circuit before returning to his van, for example)
		- he could when leaving the van start a timer (the length of which is determined by his upgrade tier) which upon ending forces him to stop what he's doing and return to his van
	- when nev returns to the van, he disappears 'into the van' and the van is set to not idle
	- the van continues its path to the previously established end point
	- when reaching the end point, a new path is set from current node to another random obj_node_nev_van node
	- when it reaches 3 or 4 AM, if Nev is not in the van he stops what he's doing and returns to the van, and the van sets a path from its current position to the van home node
